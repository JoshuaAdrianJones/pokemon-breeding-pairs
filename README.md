# Pokemon-breeding-pairs

This project allows users to search for a pokemon they want to breed and find all the other pokemon that it can breed with based on its egg groups.

In the spirit of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food I'm only supporting pokemon brilliand diamond and shining pearl currently so this would support GEN4 and below.
